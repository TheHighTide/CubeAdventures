# Cube Adventure
## About:
### What is it?
**Cube Adventures** is a basic 2d platformer where your goal is to get through all the levels as a red cube. You have to find a path through the levels that doesn't involve getting sent back to the start via (_example_) touching a lava tile. The simple nature of **Cube Adventures** makes it playable on **_every_** 3DS console in the family (**including 2DS systems**).

### Screen Shots
I have taken a couple screenshots to give you a look at what the game looks like before you download it for yourself. Take a look:

### Controls
**Cube Adventures** features incredibly simple controls making it really easy to get used to. Although the controls can be seen on the _**bottom screen** during gameplay_, I'll also list them below:
**A** = Jump / Menu Select
**DPAD Left** & **DPAD Right** = Move Left & Right
**START** = Return to main menu
**R**+**L** = Toggle dev mode
**SELECT** = Change level (Only usable while dev mode is active)
_PS: More information can be found about dev mode in the features section below or by clicking [**this link**](#dev-mode)_.

### Development
**Cube Adventures** is a passion project for me to see what I can get done on the 3DS. I have always wanted to make a game that will run on a 3DS and this is project gives me the perfect reason to get started on the project. Although this game might look low quality to many, I have spent a long time getting this working and to the point it is at right now. Even reading this text means a lot to me so I thank you.

## Features:
### Sprites
**Cube Adventures** features an incredibly _simple graphics style_. This is due to the lack of sprites the game uses. **Cube Adventures** only uses _colors_ and _squares_ to display images onto the screen making it incredibly simple and graphically simple to run. Although this might sound like it'll be hard to look at, its actually surprisingly readable and easy to understand to a new player. Although there's no sprites currently in the game, there **_might_** be some added in the future when the game gets more advanced.

### Levels
**Cube Adventures** features a number of _unique_ levels for you to explore with the ability to make your own levels by compiling the game for yourself if you so choose. Its as easy as putting `1`s where you want ground to be and `0`s where you want nothing to be.

### Dev Mode
**Cube Adventures** makes compiling your own version of the game very simple as it gives you access to a feature called "_Dev Mode_". All _Dev Mode_ does is displays the current x & y velocity as well as the players current **x** & **y position coordinates** to you on the **bottom screen**. This is extremely helpful when you start placing down coins and other items into the levels that you make.

## Final Words:
I want to thank you for checking out my game, **Cube Adventures**, and I hope you enjoy it. Also, make sure to check back from time to time to see if new feature updates are out as they might contain **bug fixes** or even **new levels**!
